		 <div class="about">
            <p>Seika Ijichi is the manager of the live house, STARRY[9] and the older sister of Nijika Ijichi.Seika used to be a bandsman - a guitarist herself, and her ability was such that the label talked about scouts. She sometimes hits Nijika and the members of Kessoku Band in her mouth, but in reality, she thinks of Kessoku Band more than anyone else. Although she didn't know that Bocchi was "guitarhero", she was quick to realize her talent as a guitarist. She can be quite of a tsundere at times, especially when it comes to her little sister Nijika.
                Seika also recognizes Bocchi's talent and potential since she saw the band's audition and tried to encourage her to expand her potential, but due to Seika always being bad in communicating her intention nicely (in addition of her initial lukewarm impression by Bocchi), Bocchi always thought about it the wrong way</p>
